# CV-Object-Detection
-Object detection using YOLOv3
-Training using YOLOv3 architecture can produce accurate results.
-YOLOv3 is perfect when you dont have huge data for training.

If we need we can make changes to the architecture, but this yolov3 model works fine by making changes only in the config file to suit our training.

We can try diffrent parameters in the training to get the best results.

To start training, run the train.py file after making necesary changes in the rest of the code and especially in the config file.
